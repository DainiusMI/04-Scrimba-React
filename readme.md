### SCRIMBA REACT (part 4)

I am taking **Scrimba** course in React after reaching the personal projects part of **freeCodeCamp** "Front End Development Libraries Projects". After first few projects done ("random quate machine" and "markdown previewer") both projects even tho completed and passed automated certification tests where not at a level I desired them to be so I decided to deepen my knowladge before continuing my jorney.

This project contains the solo project from the last part of the course

#### LESSON PROJECT (tenzies)

#### EXTRA

Since this is the last lesson project, the tutor advised us to take our time to personalize this project by adding features. Some of his suggestions are:
- put real dots on the dice
- track the number of rolls
- track the time it took to win
- save your best time to localStorage
